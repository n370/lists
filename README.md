# Twitter Lists Redux

Twitter is great for following people. But when you follow everyone and their dog,
your timeline starts to get a bit noisy. Twitter has this great feature to help with
that - Lists.

Lists allow you to have multiple timelines, so you can focus on what matters.
People in one list, dogs in the other. Only problem is, they're tucked away out of sight.

*Twitter Lists Redux* brings Lists out of hiding to where you want them.
It's so seamless, there's no setup required and you'll forget you've installed Lists Redux
because the improvements it brings are so obvious. It's like it was there all along.

#### Features
- Brings lists to your sidebar, so they're always 1 click away :pushpin:
- Adds lists to the profile hover card, so you can quickly add directly from your timeline :rocket:
- Improves usability of adding/removing lists so that you don't need to hit a small checkbox or link :star2:
- Looking for more? Feel free to file an issue with feedback/suggestions/bugs, or send a pull request!
