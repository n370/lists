# Twitter Lists Redux

Twitter is great for following people. But when you follow everyone, your timeline
starts to get a bit noisy. Twitter has this great feature to help with
that - Lists.

Lists allow you to have multiple timelines instead of following everyone,
so you can focus on what matters. Only problem is, they're tucked away out of sight.

*Twitter Lists Redux* brings Lists out of hiding to where you want them.
You won't even realise you've installed Lists Redux because the improvements
it brings is so obvious, it's as if Twitter had made Lists a first-class feature.

#### Features
- Brings lists besides your sidebar, so they're always one click away :pushpin:
- Adds lists to the profile hover card, so you can quickly add directly from your timeline :rocket:
- Improves usability of adding/removing lists so that you don't need to hit a small checkbox or link :star2:
