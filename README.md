Twitter is home to all sorts of fun and fascinating people. But when you try to 
follow everyone, your timeline starts to get too noisy and you find yourself
unable to actually catch up on what's happening.

Lists allow you to have multiple timelines, so you can focus on what matters.
Only problem is, just like all the tweets in your overflowing timeline, they're
also hard to find!

*Twitter Lists Redux* brings Lists out of hiding to where you want them.
It's so seamless, there's no setup required and you'll forget you've installed it
because it's like the improvements were there in the first place.

#### Features
- Brings lists to your sidebar so they're always 1 click away :pushpin:
- Tired of random ordering? You can sort your lists alphabetically! :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- While you're hoving over someone interesting, you can add them to a list right from the hover card :rocket:
- Improves the usability of lists so that you don't need to worry about trying to click on a small checkbox or link :star2:
- Looking for more? Feel free to file an issue with feedback/suggestions/bugs, or send a pull request!
